= seacarb2 - TODO

  * Rework bor, buffer, carb, pCa, pgas, pHinsitu, pmix, ppH and pTA
  * pH conversion in swpH
  * Kconv() does not give the same result as kconv() initial,
    but I don't see where the problem is
  * assign to subset "[<-.swobj", especially another swobj
    (or do it object by object?)
  * convert.swK() using Kconv()
  * read.table / write.table => conversion
  * check all functions for conversion (unit & pHscale)
  * Calculation of the different ions in SW from stp (see bor() to rework)
